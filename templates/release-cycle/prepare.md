## Goal

Finish every prerequisite for complete-ecosystem pre-release readiness.

## Scope and acceptance

- Apply canonical audit sections 1–8 and section 9 atomic-first prerequisites, plus RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md#prepare. Re-read current sources and workflows instead of copying obsolete v0.4.25 exceptions.
- Accept all assigned implementation/CI/docs/consumer tasks and verify release-note/epic criteria, even when no executable children have been cut. Accepted cards alone do not prove release readiness; inspect deferred or waived test debts explicitly.
- Complete implementation/security/ownership/standards and CLI/JSON/MCP parity; current Core/BaseHarbor, Demo, Console and Node Connector compatibility; real supported developer journeys, auth/mTLS and cleanup evidence.
- Complete concise EN/DE docs/reference/specs, navigation/links, changelog and actual human release message, compatibility/security/upgrade/deferred notes, strict Pages candidate builds/workflow without deployment. Keep process rules out of the product README.
- Freeze actual immutable ecosystem SHAs, candidate tree, gate requirements and verifier-compatible evidence origins. Verify all required targeted checks, runtime/platform gates and consumer receipts; missing/failed/skipped/unverified requirements block readiness.
- Deliver a reviewable readiness dossier and exact authorized-run plan. Preparation does not authorize full pre-release, promotion, tag, publication or public Pages deployment.

## Required checks

Existing canonical documentation audit, strict EN/DE MkDocs, source/contracts/build/security and affected native/consumer gates. Reuse only verifier-proven compatible evidence; do not rerun unaffected green gates.

## Dependencies and file ownership

- Procedure and sources: [release workflow](https://github.com/mcpdev80/baseharbor-plan/blob/main/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md#prepare). Stage dependencies are synchronized by `scripts/release_cycles.py sync`; do not weaken them manually.
- Owner updates this task, its release-specific audit/evidence and existing authorized PRs; coordinate product files through their normal owners. Planning goes directly to main.

## Handoff

Not started. Record actual source SHAs, outcomes, authorization where required, evidence and remaining blockers; do not infer acceptance from card creation.
