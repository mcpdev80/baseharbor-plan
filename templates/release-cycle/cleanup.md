## Goal

Reconcile previous-release leftovers before new development.

## Scope and acceptance

- Read current remote PRs, task claims, branches, release evidence and running CI across BaseHarbor, Demo, Console, Connector and this plan repository.
- Close or supersede obsolete PRs/tasks only with an integration or explicit-obsolescence reference. Preserve genuinely active/future work and owner claims; no blanket deletion of unmerged code.
- Delete incorporated temporary branches. Preserve maintained tracks, immutable tags, approval/candidate refs and evidence still needed by release verifiers; apply existing artifact-GC retention rules.
- Publish a concise kept/removed/deferred inventory with reasons on planning main. No product changes, release or task acceptance is implied by cleanup.

## Required checks

Inspect actual remote state; verify required changes are incorporated before deletion. No runtime journey or full matrix for housekeeping.

## Dependencies and file ownership

- Procedure and sources: [release workflow](https://github.com/mcpdev80/baseharbor-plan/blob/main/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md#cleanup). Stage dependencies are synchronized by `scripts/release_cycles.py sync`; do not weaken them manually.
- Owner updates this task, its release-specific audit/evidence and existing authorized PRs; coordinate product files through their normal owners. Planning goes directly to main.

## Handoff

Not started. Record actual source SHAs, outcomes, authorization where required, evidence and remaining blockers; do not infer acceptance from card creation.
