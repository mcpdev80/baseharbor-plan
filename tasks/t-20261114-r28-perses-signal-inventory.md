## Goal

Inventory actual metrics, labels, exporters, logs and trace bindings produced by supported Core providers; mark gaps instead of inventing coverage.

## Scope and file ownership

Read-only code/evidence inventory, no speculative exporter deployment. Inspect the current Core source before implementing; use existing provider/capability, ownership, TLS and lifecycle contracts. Coordinate shared registry, CLI, CI and generated docs with their owners. Preserve unrelated work.

## Verified starting points and bounded implementation

All referenced paths exist at Core `cd77e20e`; fetch actual current `develop` and recheck behavior before editing. Do not treat this static reference as a runtime proof.

Produce a machine-reviewable matrix of actual metric names, labels, producers, Target/app scope, whether scraped and prerequisites. Current code references `up` for application/provider series; verify each live fixture rather than equating source text with collection. Include logs/traces, missing data and exporter gaps.

## Acceptance

- Use a verified, pinned Perses release and native plugin/format where applicable; do not assume Grafana UI APIs or dashboard JSON are Perses-compatible. Verify real provider signals and mark missing/unsupported coverage explicitly.
- Scope all access by actual Target/tenant permissions, fail closed on unknown ownership or missing authorization, and keep secrets out of logs, manifests and audit. Optional visualization must not force new application capabilities or mandatory services.
- Preserve independent Prometheus, Loki and Tempo backend ownership; remove only owned resources. Inventory actual metrics, labels, exporters, logs and trace bindings produced by supported Core providers; mark gaps instead of inventing coverage.
- For alerting, define the real rule evaluator and notification owner in the approved contract. Do not claim native Perses alerting/routing parity without evidence, nor enable external notifications by default.

## Required checks

Record exact candidate SHA and focused tests by name. Route every changed test through an existing CI check/native gate with trigger and actual execution; no skipped/faked native proof. Require isolated Docker and rootless Podman only when runtime risk requires them; no blanket full matrix. Produce deterministic negative/authorization/ownership tests as appropriate.

## Dependencies and handoff

Prerequisites are encoded in `depends_on`. One worker per card/branch/PR, no concurrent writes to shared files. Codex/Owner-delegated Maintainer reviews and merges only after real checks; no independent-review claim. Archive Console/Node Connector repos are excluded. No implementation or release has occurred.
