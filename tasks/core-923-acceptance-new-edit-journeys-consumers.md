## Goal

The integrated v0.4.26 product surface works for developers and existing consumers on the real candidate. Lane: targeted product acceptance.

## Scope

- In scope: existing Demo/consumer fixtures and release-specific gate/evidence inventories.
- Out of scope: product source changes, except a concrete found bug through its own fix PR. Preparation is not approval for a complete pre-release or promotion.

## Acceptance

- Native Docker and rootless Podman: fresh app without managed capabilities, create with real dependencies, edit/add/remove/provider switch, No/Cancel safety and data/shared preservation covered in a targeted way.
- Qualifies the actual current immutable BaseHarbor/Demo/Console/Connector revisions; CLI/JSON/MCP semantics through the real entry point; no old consumer PASS as a substitute.
- Uses existing gates and the core-888 plan/verifier; reuses green gates, also from failed overall runs, only with proven unchanged inputs.
- Isolates found bugs small; no full journey per fix. Final complete necessary coverage and an independent documented developer path.

## Required checks

- First the predecessors' component/contract evidence, then the necessary real consumer/runtime gates. Source/docs are not run serially before every diagnostic run. Coordinate with #897–#901 for candidate/evidence/pilot.

## Dependencies and file ownership

- Depends on core-921 and core-922; candidate/evidence/GC (#897–#900; core-900 still open) must be complete before.

## Handoff

- Not started.

The [standard v0.4.26 task rules](../releases/v0.4.26.md#standard-rules-for-v0426-tasks) apply.
